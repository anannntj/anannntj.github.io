<hr><h1>                                        RESOURCE EFFICIENCY
Resource efficiency means reducing the quantity of inputs needed to produce a unit of output; simply put, doing more with less. Not only does the reduced consumption of inputs (such as raw materials, energy and water) lead to reduced by-products (including waste, wastewater, air pollution and greenhouse gases per unit of output), it also reduces demand on upstream supply of these inputs along with their environmental costs.<br>
Resource efficiency isn’t only valuable because it is essential for sustained economic growth. Reducing environmental impacts also contributes to the quality of life that comes from living in a healthy, attractive environment.<br> 

Resource efficiency and circular economy aims at achieving sustainable development. As you can see in the given venn diagram both resource efficiency and circular economy objects for the efficient management of waste.<br>
MOTIVE<br>
 So OUR motive is to extract more value from resources, while minimising waste and emissions.<br>
There are genuine opportunities for national and city leaders to improve resource efficiency, reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance ecosystems and minimize environmental risks. Resource efficiency is key for cities to move towards a green economy and contribute to global sustainability. They bring efficiency gains and technological innovation through the proximity of economic activities, while reducing resource and energy consumption as well as providing increased opportunities for consumer choices and sustainable lifestyles.<br>
 These include clean technologies, industry, renewable energies, water services, transport, waste management, green buildings, and sustainable agriculture and forests.<br><br>

Improved record keeping and reporting can help you keep track of waste, emissions and costs. This can help you assess your performance and make positive changes.<br><br>


RECYCLING<br>
Mainly due to the high labour costs, in many countries automated material separation processes are nowadays commonly adopted for recycling complex products such as e-waste. In consequence, proper understanding on the performance of these automated separation processes and the overall efficiency of multi-stage recycling schemes is required for adequate investment planning.<br>  
To illustrate this, the recycling of LCD TVs is analysed in detail as a case study.<br>
Ok so if we talk of benefits  of recycling there are many,
Benefits of Recycling:<br>
•	Recycling reduces the need for landfill waste.<br>
•	Recycling reduces pollution.<br>
•	Recycling saves energy.<br>
•	Recycling decreases greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
•	Recycling conserves natural resources.<br>
•	Recycling helps sustain the environment.<br>


•	Locate recycling bins near trash containers throughout the property to encourage recycling.<br>
•	Clearly label recycling containers.<br>
•	Keep recycling areas and containers clean and free of odors.<br>
•	Monitor for pests.<br>
•	Create an incentive program to reward tenants who recycle properly and regularly.<br><br>


5RS PRINCIPLE , the basic principle involves
The 5 R's – Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle.
5Rs: the Policy stresses on 5Rs Principle  and claims it as key to drive resource efficiency.  The agenda is to develop a circular economy.<br>
•	The agenda of  Reduce is To limit the amount of materials you use<br>
•	Reuse is To use an item again. This is actually even better than recycling because the process of recycling uses some energy.<br> 
•	
•	Recycle: To collect items such as newspaper, bottles, and cans and bring to a plant where they can be made into something new as already explained.<br> 
•	Refuse: Avoid purchasing or using items that are not recyclable. For example say plastic , replace it with other alternatives.<br>
•	Repurpose: to use it for another purpose than its original.<br><br> 

DAMS<br>
Dams  serve to ensure an adequate supply of water by storing water in times of surplus and releasing it in times of scarcity, thus also preventing or mitigating floods and making a significant contribution to the efficient management of finite water .  If we talk about the best location for dams , then one of the best places for a dam is a narrow part of a deep river valley . the valley slides then can act as natural walls. The primary function of the dams structure is to fill gap in the natural reservoir line left by the stream channel.
•	The basic uses of dams include irrigation in fields, flood control,water storage, debris control and water supply. Apart from this also for  electrical generation.<br><br>


SOLAR PANELS<br>
 SOLAR PANELS ARE AN   ARRANGEMENT OF SOLAR CELLS MOUNTED IN  A FRAME. Solar cells are typically made from silicon, which is a semiconductor and can generate electricity. This process is known as the “photovoltaic effect” 
SO IF WE TALK ABOUT A HOUSE,
16 solar panels are required to run a house.<br><br>

WORKING AT HOMES<br>
Solar panels work by absorbing sunlight with photovoltaic cells, generating direct current (DC) energy and then converting it to usable alternating current (AC) energy with the help of inverter technology. AC energy then flows through the home’s electrical panel and is distributed accordingly. Here are the main steps for how solar panels work for your home:<br>
1.	Photovoltaic cells absorb the sun’s energy and convert it to DC electricity<br>
2.	The solar inverter converts DC electricity from your solar modules to AC electricity, which is used by most home appliances<br>
3.	Electricity flows through your home, powering electronic devices<br>
4.	Excess electricity produced by solar panels is fed to the electric grid<br><br>

Solar farms<br>
Solar farms are large scale solar installations where photovoltaic (PV) panels, referred to as solar panels, or other means of collecting solar energy, like concentrating solar systems are used to harvest the suns power.<br><br> 


Working of solar farms
– They generate electricity locally and feed into the local electricity grid using a free source of energy (the sun) to generate electricity  on bright cloudy days as well as in direct sunlight.<br>
– For every  5MW installed, a solar farm will power over 1,500 homes annually (based on an average annual consumption of 3,300 kWh of electricity for a house) and save 2,150 tonnes of CO2. Approximately 25 acres of land is required for every 5 megawatts (MW) of installation.<br><br>

HOW IS IT USEFUL<br>
Sun is a renewable source of efficiency and is expected to last for 5 billion years. Hence solar panels are one of the best method for resource efficiency.
Solar panels can be used to generate a portion of your home's power in order to reduce your dependency on traditional power sources.
 For instance, you can install panels to provide electricity just for appliances or lighting, to reduce your dependency on the utility company, as well as lower your bill.
  If you live in an area with high energy rates and a suitable solar rating and can afford the initial investment, it's worth installing solar panels in your home  — for the good of the environment and your wallet.  
solar could contribute 20% of total electricity consumption by 2030.<br><br> 

What if there is no sunlight , there are two solutions net metering and solar storage technology
Net metering - Net metering (also known as net energy metering or NEM) is a solar incentive that allows you to store energy in the electric grid. When your solar panels produce more electricity than you need, that energy is sent to the grid in exchange for credits. Then, at night or other times when your solar panels are underproducing, you pull energy from the grid and use these credits to offset the costs of that energy.
Solar storage technology.<br>
Energy storage systems provide a wide array of technological approaches to managing our power supply in order to create a more resilient energy infrastructure and bring cost savings to utilities and consumers. These include<br><br>
•	Batteries – a range of electrochemical storage solutions, including advanced chemistry batteries, flow batteries, and capacitors<br><br>
•	Thermal – capturing heat and cold to create energy on demand or offset energy needs<br><br>
•	 Mechanical Storage – other innovative technologies to harness kinetic or gravitational energy to store electricity<br><br>
•	Hydrogen – excess electricity generation can be converted into hydrogen via electrolysis and stored<br><br>


 
 WINDMILLS<br>
A windmill is a structure that converts wind power into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades, specifically to mill grain, but the term is also extended to windpumps, wind turbines and other applications.
<br><br>
Wind farms<br>
A wind farm or wind park, also called a wind power station or wind power plant, is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity. Most onshore wind turbines have a capacity of 2-3 megawatts (MW), which can produce over 6 million kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity every year. That’s enough to meet the electricity demand of around 1,500 average households.
<br><br>

 
.

Wind energy is a source of renewable energy. It does not contaminate, it is inexhaustible and reduces the use of fossil fuels, which are the origin of greenhouse gasses that cause global warming. In addition, wind energy is a “native” energy, because it is available practically everywhere on the plant, which contributes to reducing energy imports and to creating wealth and local employment.

<hr><h1>CLEAN FOOD</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="d">
<hr><h1>Consistently eating clean foods fills your body with plentiful vitamins and minerals, high-quality protein and healthy fats, which improve heart and brain health, assist with weight management, build a stronger immune system and increase energy levels, among other benefits.
Basically, clean food is essential for the health of people or citizens of our city who are the source of all power.<br><br>

RISK OF PESTICIDES<br>
Some studies have indicated that the use of pesticides even at low doses can increase the risk of certain cancers, such as leukemia, brain tumors, breast cancer and prostate cancer.etc.<br>
Children and fetuses are most vulnerable to pesticide exposure because their immune systems, bodies, and brains are still developing. Exposure at an early age may cause developmental delays, behavioral disorders, autism, immune system harm, and motor dysfunction.<br>
Pregnant women are more vulnerable due to the added stress pesticides put on their already taxed organs. Plus, pesticides can be passed from mother to child in the womb, as well as through breast milk.<br><br>
 
 Clean milk’ should be produced by healthy animal handled by healthy milker in an environment that ensures safety from physical or biological hazard and it must possess a good keeping quality without being heat treated. Clean milk production (CMP) involves a set of preventative practices that helps in keeping the animal healthy & free from diseases like mastitis, proper care monitoring of individual animal to get the best quality milk without compromising with animal’s productivity.<br><br>
 
Milkbeinga complete food is nature’s most wonderful gift to mankind. The high nutritional content of milk makes it a perfect growth medium for innumerable microorganisms including pathogenic. The spoilage microbes cause the milk quality to deteriorate & thereby causing great economic loss to farmers. On the other hand, contaminated milk may cause milk-borne infections like Typhoid, food poisoning, and Tuberculosis etc. which negatively impacts public health. The use of chemical contaminants such as antibiotics has made milk chain vulnerable.<br><br>
 
 
 
Practices related to milker<br>
The person involved in caring & milking of the animal is the key human being who comes in contact with the dairy animal. His awareness regarding health aspects, good animal husbandry practices & clean milk production, his personal habits plays a pivotal role in keeping the animals happy & getting best productivity. The milking person should get regular health checkups done, they should follow good hygienic practices like nails should be trimmed regularly, should keep themselves free from injury, cuts etc. They should wash & sanitize their hands before milking.  Clothes should be clean, head should be covered; new mask should be worneach time. The milkers should avoid coughing, sneezing at the time of milking.<br><br>
 
Practices Related to the Animal<br>
Apart from following good management practices like purchasing good breed animals, keeping proper record etc. special emphasis should be laid on health of the animal. Sanitary precautions to prevent and control the diseases should be adopted. The animals should be well groomed. The animals should be examined periodically for udder and other infections. Infected animals should be treated by a qualified vet.Animals suffering from infectious diseases should be isolated. The milk of the infected animal should never be pooled with the bulk milk until the animalrecovers from the illness fully.<br>
 
HYGIENE PRACTICES DURING MILKING<br>
During milking the first few ml of milk should be discarded, as it contains a large number of microorganisms. The initial milk should be collected in a cup or a utensil and should not be thrown on the floor, so that flies and other insects may not be attracted towards it.The milking should be complete, with no milk left in the udder after milking.<br> 
Unhygienic practices such as dipping the fingers in milk and then wetting the teats tosoften them should not be permitted. Milking with the full hands and not with the knuckles is preferred as the knuckling  leads tomore chances of teat injury.Sick cows should be milked at the end to prevent infection. The animals should be dried off 60-70 days before calving.<br><br>
 
Hygieneof Milking Utensils:<br>
The clean milk production practices are useless if the clean milk is t o be stored in utensils that are not clean. Milk being a perishable commodity and easy carrier of off flavours has special requirement with regard to storage infrastructure & the milking. The milking utensils should be uniform; they should have small mouths to avoid external contamination.They should be made of a non-rusting and non-absorbent material such as aluminium orgalvanized iron. Stainless steel would be ideal. The use ofvessels such as empty paint buckets, dalda tins, pesticide/insecticide containers, teapots etc. should beavoided. The utensils should be free from dents, cracks and crevices. The utensils should be scrubbed and cleaned before and after each milking.<br><br><br>

VERTICAL FARMING<br>
Vertical farming is the practice of producing food on vertically inclined surfaces. Instead of farming vegetables and other foods on a single level, such as in a field or a greenhouse, this method produces foods in vertically stacked layers commonly integrated into other structures like a skyscraper, shipping container or repurposed warehouse.<br><br>

How Vertical Farming Works<br>
There are four critical areas in understanding how vertical farming works:<br> 1. Physical layout<br> 2. Lighting<br> 3. Growing medium<br>  4. Sustainability features.<br>
Firstly, the primary goal of vertical farming is producing more foods per square meter. To accomplish this goal, crops are cultivated in stacked layers in a tower life structure.<br> Secondly, a perfect combination of natural and artificial lights is used to maintain the perfect light level in the room. Technologies such as rotating beds are used to improve lighting efficiency.<br>
Thirdly, instead of soil, aeroponic, aquaponic or hydroponic growing mediums are used.<br> Peat moss or coconut husks and similar non-soil mediums are very common in vertical farming. Finally, the vertical farming method uses various sustainability features to offset the energy cost of farming. In fact, vertical farming uses 95 percent less water.<br> <br>


Advantages of vertical farming<br>
It offers a plan to handle future food demands<br>
It allows crops to grow year-round<br>
It uses significantly less water<br>
Weather doesn't affect the crops<br>
More organic crops can be grown<br>
There is less exposure to chemicals and disease<br><br>

Preparation for Future: By 2050, around 80 percent of the world population is expected to live in urban areas, and the growing population will lead to an increased demand for food. The efficient use of vertical farming may perhaps play a significant role in preparing for such a challenge.<br> 
Increased And Year-Round Crop Production: Vertical farming allows us to produce more crops from the same square footage of growing area. In fact, 1 acre of an indoor area offers equivalent production to at least 4-6 acres of outdoor capacity. According to an independent estimate, a 30-story building with a basal area of 5 acres can potentially produce an equivalent of 2,400 acres of conventional horizontal farming. Additionally, year-round crop production is possible in a controlled indoor environment which is completely controlled by vertical farming technologies.<br>
Less Use Of Water In Cultivation: Vertical farming allows us to produce crops with 70-95 percent less water than required for normal cultivation. <br>
Not Affected By Unfavorable Weather Conditions: Crops in a field can be adversely affected by natural calamities such as torrential rains, cyclones, flooding or severe droughts—events which are becoming increasingly common as a result of global warming. Indoor vertical farms are less likely to feel the brunt of the unfavorable weather, providing greater certainty of harvest output throughout the year.<br>
Increased Production of Organic Crops: As crops are produced in a well-controlled indoor environment without the use of chemical pesticides, vertical farming allows us to grow pesticide-free and organic crops.<br> 
And organic crops have the following features;<br><br>
Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat.<br><br>

Organic food is often fresher because it doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer.<br><br> 

Organic produce is often (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms near where it is sold.<br><br>

Organic farming is better for the environment. Organic farming practices reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms.<br><br>

Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals are given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which help to keep them healthy.<br><br>

Organic meat and milk are richer in certain nutrients. Results of a 2016 European study show that levels of certain nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions.<br><br>
 
Human and Environmentally Friendly: Indoor vertical farming can significantly lessen the occupational hazards associated with traditional farming. Farmers are not exposed to hazards related to heavy farming equipment, diseases like malaria, poisonous chemicals and so on. As it does not disturb animals and trees inland areas, it is good for biodiversity as well.<br><br></h1><hr>
