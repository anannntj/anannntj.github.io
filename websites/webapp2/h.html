<hr><h1>                                        RESOURCE EFFICIENCY
Resource efficiency means reducing the quantity of inputs needed to produce a unit of output; simply put, doing more with less. Not only does the reduced consumption of inputs (such as raw materials, energy and water) lead to reduced by-products (including waste, wastewater, air pollution and greenhouse gases per unit of output), it also reduces demand on upstream supply of these inputs along with their environmental costs.<br>
Resource efficiency isn’t only valuable because it is essential for sustained economic growth. Reducing environmental impacts also contributes to the quality of life that comes from living in a healthy, attractive environment.<br> 

Resource efficiency and circular economy aims at achieving sustainable development. As you can see in the given venn diagram both resource efficiency and circular economy objects for the efficient management of waste.<br>
MOTIVE<br>
 So OUR motive is to extract more value from resources, while minimising waste and emissions.<br>
There are genuine opportunities for national and city leaders to improve resource efficiency, reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance ecosystems and minimize environmental risks. Resource efficiency is key for cities to move towards a green economy and contribute to global sustainability. They bring efficiency gains and technological innovation through the proximity of economic activities, while reducing resource and energy consumption as well as providing increased opportunities for consumer choices and sustainable lifestyles.<br>
 These include clean technologies, industry, renewable energies, water services, transport, waste management, green buildings, and sustainable agriculture and forests.<br><br>

Improved storage can make your site safer. It can minimise risks to health and the environment.<br>
Conserving energy and water can help to reduce your costs and minimise emissions.<br>
Improved record keeping and reporting can help you keep track of waste, emissions and costs. This can help you assess your performance and make positive changes.<br><br>


RECYCLING<br>
Mainly due to the high labour costs, in many countries automated material separation processes are nowadays commonly adopted for recycling complex products such as e-waste. In consequence, proper understanding on the performance of these automated separation processes and the overall efficiency of multi-stage recycling schemes is required for adequate investment planning.<br>  
To illustrate this, the recycling of LCD TVs is analysed in detail as a case study.<br>
Ok so if we talk of benefits  of recycling there are many,
Benefits of Recycling:<br>
•	Recycling reduces the need for landfill waste.<br>
•	Recycling reduces pollution.<br>
•	Recycling saves energy.<br>
•	Recycling decreases greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
•	Recycling conserves natural resources.<br>
•	Recycling helps sustain the environment.<br>


•	Locate recycling bins near trash containers throughout the property to encourage recycling.<br>
•	Clearly label recycling containers.<br>
•	Keep recycling areas and containers clean and free of odors.<br>
•	Monitor for pests.<br>
•	Create an incentive program to reward tenants who recycle properly and regularly.<br><br>


5RS PRINCIPLE , the basic principle involves
The 5 R's – Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle.
5Rs: the Policy stresses on 5Rs Principle  and claims it as key to drive resource efficiency.  The agenda is to develop a circular economy.<br>
•	The agenda of  Reduce is To limit the amount of materials you use<br>
•	Reuse is To use an item again. This is actually even better than recycling because the process of recycling uses some energy.<br> 
•	
•	Recycle: To collect items such as newspaper, bottles, and cans and bring to a plant where they can be made into something new as already explained.<br> 
•	Refuse: Avoid purchasing or using items that are not recyclable. For example say plastic , replace it with other alternatives.<br>
•	Repurpose: to use it for another purpose than its original.<br><br> 

DAMS<br>
Dams  serve to ensure an adequate supply of water by storing water in times of surplus and releasing it in times of scarcity, thus also preventing or mitigating floods and making a significant contribution to the efficient management of finite water .  If we talk about the best location for dams , then one of the best places for a dam is a narrow part of a deep river valley . the valley slides then can act as natural walls. The primary function of the dams structure is to fill gap in the natural reservoir line left by the stream channel.
•	The basic uses of dams include irrigation in fields, flood control,water storage, debris control and water supply. Apart from this also for  electrical generation.<br><br>


SOLAR PANELS<br>
 SOLAR PANELS ARE AN   ARRANGEMENT OF SOLAR CELLS MOUNTED IN  A FRAME. Solar cells are typically made from silicon, which is a semiconductor and can generate electricity. This process is known as the “photovoltaic effect” 
SO IF WE TALK ABOUT A HOUSE,
16 solar panels are required to run a house.<br><br>

WORKING AT HOMES<br>
Solar panels work by absorbing sunlight with photovoltaic cells, generating direct current (DC) energy and then converting it to usable alternating current (AC) energy with the help of inverter technology. AC energy then flows through the home’s electrical panel and is distributed accordingly. Here are the main steps for how solar panels work for your home:<br>
1.	Photovoltaic cells absorb the sun’s energy and convert it to DC electricity<br>
2.	The solar inverter converts DC electricity from your solar modules to AC electricity, which is used by most home appliances<br>
3.	Electricity flows through your home, powering electronic devices<br>
4.	Excess electricity produced by solar panels is fed to the electric grid<br><br>

Solar farms<br>
Solar farms are large scale solar installations where photovoltaic (PV) panels, referred to as solar panels, or other means of collecting solar energy, like concentrating solar systems are used to harvest the suns power.<br><br> 


Working of solar farms
– They generate electricity locally and feed into the local electricity grid using a free source of energy (the sun) to generate electricity  on bright cloudy days as well as in direct sunlight.<br>
– For every  5MW installed, a solar farm will power over 1,500 homes annually (based on an average annual consumption of 3,300 kWh of electricity for a house) and save 2,150 tonnes of CO2. Approximately 25 acres of land is required for every 5 megawatts (MW) of installation.<br><br>

HOW IS IT USEFUL<br>
Sun is a renewable source of efficiency and is expected to last for 5 billion years. Hence solar panels are one of the best method for resource efficiency.
Solar panels can be used to generate a portion of your home's power in order to reduce your dependency on traditional power sources.
 For instance, you can install panels to provide electricity just for appliances or lighting, to reduce your dependency on the utility company, as well as lower your bill.
  If you live in an area with high energy rates and a suitable solar rating and can afford the initial investment, it's worth installing solar panels in your home  — for the good of the environment and your wallet.  
solar could contribute 20% of total electricity consumption by 2030.<br><br> 

What if there is no sunlight , there are two solutions net metering and solar storage technology
Net metering - Net metering (also known as net energy metering or NEM) is a solar incentive that allows you to store energy in the electric grid. When your solar panels produce more electricity than you need, that energy is sent to the grid in exchange for credits. Then, at night or other times when your solar panels are underproducing, you pull energy from the grid and use these credits to offset the costs of that energy.
Solar storage technology.<br>
Energy storage systems provide a wide array of technological approaches to managing our power supply in order to create a more resilient energy infrastructure and bring cost savings to utilities and consumers. These include<br><br>
•	Batteries – a range of electrochemical storage solutions, including advanced chemistry batteries, flow batteries, and capacitors<br><br>
•	Thermal – capturing heat and cold to create energy on demand or offset energy needs<br><br>
•	 Mechanical Storage – other innovative technologies to harness kinetic or gravitational energy to store electricity<br><br>
•	Hydrogen – excess electricity generation can be converted into hydrogen via electrolysis and stored<br><br>


 
 WINDMILLS<br>
A windmill is a structure that converts wind power into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades, specifically to mill grain, but the term is also extended to windpumps, wind turbines and other applications.
<br><br>
Wind farms<br>
A wind farm or wind park, also called a wind power station or wind power plant, is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity. Most onshore wind turbines have a capacity of 2-3 megawatts (MW), which can produce over 6 million kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity every year. That’s enough to meet the electricity demand of around 1,500 average households.
<br><br>

 
.

Wind energy is a source of renewable energy. It does not contaminate, it is inexhaustible and reduces the use of fossil fuels, which are the origin of greenhouse gasses that cause global warming. In addition, wind energy is a “native” energy, because it is available practically everywhere on the plant, which contributes to reducing energy imports and to creating wealth and local employment.

<hr><h1>CLEAN FOOD</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="d">
<hr><h1>Consistently eating clean foods fills your body with plentiful vitamins and minerals, high-quality protein and healthy fats, which improve heart and brain health, assist with weight management, build a stronger immune system and increase energy levels, among other benefits.
Basically, clean food is essential for the health of people or citizens of our city who are the source of all power.<br><br>

RISK OF PESTICIDES<br>
Some studies have indicated that the use of pesticides even at low doses can increase the risk of certain cancers, such as leukemia, brain tumors, breast cancer and prostate cancer.etc.<br>
Children and fetuses are most vulnerable to pesticide exposure because their immune systems, bodies, and brains are still developing. Exposure at an early age may cause developmental delays, behavioral disorders, autism, immune system harm, and motor dysfunction.<br>
Pregnant women are more vulnerable due to the added stress pesticides put on their already taxed organs. Plus, pesticides can be passed from mother to child in the womb, as well as through breast milk.<br><br>
 
 Clean milk’ should be produced by healthy animal handled by healthy milker in an environment that ensures safety from physical or biological hazard and it must possess a good keeping quality without being heat treated. Clean milk production (CMP) involves a set of preventative practices that helps in keeping the animal healthy & free from diseases like mastitis, proper care monitoring of individual animal to get the best quality milk without compromising with animal’s productivity.<br><br>
 
Milkbeinga complete food is nature’s most wonderful gift to mankind. The high nutritional content of milk makes it a perfect growth medium for innumerable microorganisms including pathogenic. The spoilage microbes cause the milk quality to deteriorate & thereby causing great economic loss to farmers. On the other hand, contaminated milk may cause milk-borne infections like Typhoid, food poisoning, and Tuberculosis etc. which negatively impacts public health. The use of chemical contaminants such as antibiotics has made milk chain vulnerable.<br><br>
 
 
 
Practices related to milker<br>
The person involved in caring & milking of the animal is the key human being who comes in contact with the dairy animal. His awareness regarding health aspects, good animal husbandry practices & clean milk production, his personal habits plays a pivotal role in keeping the animals happy & getting best productivity. The milking person should get regular health checkups done, they should follow good hygienic practices like nails should be trimmed regularly, should keep themselves free from injury, cuts etc. They should wash & sanitize their hands before milking.  Clothes should be clean, head should be covered; new mask should be worneach time. The milkers should avoid coughing, sneezing at the time of milking.<br><br>
 
Practices Related to the Animal<br>
Apart from following good management practices like purchasing good breed animals, keeping proper record etc. special emphasis should be laid on health of the animal. Sanitary precautions to prevent and control the diseases should be adopted. The animals should be well groomed. The animals should be examined periodically for udder and other infections. Infected animals should be treated by a qualified vet.Animals suffering from infectious diseases should be isolated. The milk of the infected animal should never be pooled with the bulk milk until the animalrecovers from the illness fully.<br>
 
HYGIENE PRACTICES DURING MILKING<br>
During milking the first few ml of milk should be discarded, as it contains a large number of microorganisms. The initial milk should be collected in a cup or a utensil and should not be thrown on the floor, so that flies and other insects may not be attracted towards it.The milking should be complete, with no milk left in the udder after milking.<br> 
Unhygienic practices such as dipping the fingers in milk and then wetting the teats tosoften them should not be permitted. Milking with the full hands and not with the knuckles is preferred as the knuckling  leads tomore chances of teat injury.Sick cows should be milked at the end to prevent infection. The animals should be dried off 60-70 days before calving.<br><br>
 
Hygieneof Milking Utensils:<br>
The clean milk production practices are useless if the clean milk is t o be stored in utensils that are not clean. Milk being a perishable commodity and easy carrier of off flavours has special requirement with regard to storage infrastructure & the milking. The milking utensils should be uniform; they should have small mouths to avoid external contamination.They should be made of a non-rusting and non-absorbent material such as aluminium orgalvanized iron. Stainless steel would be ideal. The use ofvessels such as empty paint buckets, dalda tins, pesticide/insecticide containers, teapots etc. should beavoided. The utensils should be free from dents, cracks and crevices. The utensils should be scrubbed and cleaned before and after each milking.<br><br><br>

VERTICAL FARMING<br>
Vertical farming is the practice of producing food on vertically inclined surfaces. Instead of farming vegetables and other foods on a single level, such as in a field or a greenhouse, this method produces foods in vertically stacked layers commonly integrated into other structures like a skyscraper, shipping container or repurposed warehouse.<br><br>

How Vertical Farming Works<br>
There are four critical areas in understanding how vertical farming works:<br> 1. Physical layout<br> 2. Lighting<br> 3. Growing medium<br>  4. Sustainability features.<br>
Firstly, the primary goal of vertical farming is producing more foods per square meter. To accomplish this goal, crops are cultivated in stacked layers in a tower life structure.<br> Secondly, a perfect combination of natural and artificial lights is used to maintain the perfect light level in the room. Technologies such as rotating beds are used to improve lighting efficiency.<br>
Thirdly, instead of soil, aeroponic, aquaponic or hydroponic growing mediums are used.<br> Peat moss or coconut husks and similar non-soil mediums are very common in vertical farming. Finally, the vertical farming method uses various sustainability features to offset the energy cost of farming. In fact, vertical farming uses 95 percent less water.<br> <br>


Advantages of vertical farming<br>
It offers a plan to handle future food demands<br>
It allows crops to grow year-round<br>
It uses significantly less water<br>
Weather doesn't affect the crops<br>
More organic crops can be grown<br>
There is less exposure to chemicals and disease<br><br>

Preparation for Future: By 2050, around 80 percent of the world population is expected to live in urban areas, and the growing population will lead to an increased demand for food. The efficient use of vertical farming may perhaps play a significant role in preparing for such a challenge.<br> 
Increased And Year-Round Crop Production: Vertical farming allows us to produce more crops from the same square footage of growing area. In fact, 1 acre of an indoor area offers equivalent production to at least 4-6 acres of outdoor capacity. According to an independent estimate, a 30-story building with a basal area of 5 acres can potentially produce an equivalent of 2,400 acres of conventional horizontal farming. Additionally, year-round crop production is possible in a controlled indoor environment which is completely controlled by vertical farming technologies.<br>
Less Use Of Water In Cultivation: Vertical farming allows us to produce crops with 70-95 percent less water than required for normal cultivation. <br>
Not Affected By Unfavorable Weather Conditions: Crops in a field can be adversely affected by natural calamities such as torrential rains, cyclones, flooding or severe droughts—events which are becoming increasingly common as a result of global warming. Indoor vertical farms are less likely to feel the brunt of the unfavorable weather, providing greater certainty of harvest output throughout the year.<br>
Increased Production of Organic Crops: As crops are produced in a well-controlled indoor environment without the use of chemical pesticides, vertical farming allows us to grow pesticide-free and organic crops.<br> 
And organic crops have the following features;<br><br>
Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat.<br><br>

Organic food is often fresher because it doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer.<br><br> 

Organic produce is often (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms near where it is sold.<br><br>

Organic farming is better for the environment. Organic farming practices reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms.<br><br>

Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals are given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which help to keep them healthy.<br><br>

Organic meat and milk are richer in certain nutrients. Results of a 2016 European study show that levels of certain nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions.<br><br>
 
Human and Environmentally Friendly: Indoor vertical farming can significantly lessen the occupational hazards associated with traditional farming. Farmers are not exposed to hazards related to heavy farming equipment, diseases like malaria, poisonous chemicals and so on. As it does not disturb animals and trees inland areas, it is good for biodiversity as well.<br><br></h1><hr>

<hr><h1>GOVERNMENT DESIGN</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="f">
<hr><h1>

Even though the city will be partially controlled by the centre, the local government of the city would exercise enormous power related to the functioning of the city. The city government will be divided on various basis. The first will on the basis of the means by which one became a part of the government. The other will be on the hierarchy basis, and the third will be on a department basis. <br><br>

By the first basis, the government will be divided into elected and appointed.
The elected part of the government will have the final say in a decision, while both have a say during the discussion process. The appointed members will also be the on-ground executors of any policy or decision.<br> 
PROCESS OF ELECTIONS OF ELECTED MEMBERS :<br>
Elections will be held every 2 years. Each residential sector will elect 1 sector representative. That would account for 92 elected members in total. Apart from that, each member needs to choose one or more departments or can choose (others) and make a new department. A member needs to have qualification and experience in the field linked to their department, which also calls for a compulsive minimum of undergraduate education to contest in elections.<br> 
The process to run for an elected representative: The body that controls the election process will be the election department of the city. This is the only department with no direct influence of elected members and doesn’t have an elected department head. <br>
Anyone who wishes to contest for elections will only have to fill an application form and submit copies of all required documents which will include the green score of that person, copies of education and experience certificates, proof of residential address, medical reports, criminal records, assets, liabilities and court cases. Apart from this, an applicant may submit any other documents which they deem necessary. (these will be made public if one stands for elections.<br> 
After all the documents have been submitted, they will then be verified with official records, universities and schools, hospitals, courts, police etc. After the verification process is over, and one satisfies the minimum education, experience, health	(to ensure one is able to perform their duty to the fullest and to prevent mid-term deaths) and other legal requirements to participate in elections, they will then be eligible to take the pre-election test which will happen exactly 4 weeks before the election day. This will test the ability of a possible elected member of the local. government.<br>
 It would include questions about the current policies, ask to elaborate on their achievements or drawbacks or both. There would then be questions that are more specific to sustainability. After this, there will be questions department wise, for which one is required at least answer questions related to their chosen department(s). One wishing to run for city head is required to attempt all the department tests and everyone will get time according to how many sections, of the department paper, are they attempting.<br> 
At the end of the test, the potential elected members will be given 1 hour to write down an essay about the changes they are wishing to make to the city. After this, all the information submitted will be made public on the city governments website in a week after the test, this will include the initially submitted documents, any pieces that the elective body finds during verification, and deems necessary and last but not the least, the answers as to the questions of the test and the essay as written by the candidate so that the public is well aware of who they cast their vote to.<br>  
After this, all candidates will have 2 weeks to campaign, of course under some restrictions set by the election department to prevent malpractices. After the 2 weeks are over, only one will be left to the elections. During this week, no campaigning will be allowed and on the first day of the week, all candidates will be required to give public speeches as well.<br>
The election day will be a public holiday. All the schools will turn into voting booths and one can vote in any of the 2 schools in their residential sector. The winners of each sector will be announced 3 days after the elections. On the 4th day, all the elected members have to assemble in the city hall for the mayor and elected department head elections which will be indirectly elected. All the elected members not running for the particular post, are allowed to vote for the members running for department heads and mayor. Once the results of these elections are out, the department heads and mayor form the head council which meets weekly to discuss the cities functioning. Any decision by the head council has to be deliberated upon and passed with ⅔ votes by the main council along with any edit they wish to make. The main council is the council of all appointed heads, appointed department board members along with the elected members which also includes the mayor and department heads. In case the collective votes to pass a decision is greater than 80%, from the side of the elected representatives of the main council but the total votes to pass a particular decision is between ½ and ⅔,  then the decision will be made to the positive end.<br> 
By hierarchy basis, As already said, the elected body will have 3 levels. The highest will be the mayor. The mayor would head the head council and main council. The mayor is the only person that can influence every decision taken by any department of the local governing body. The mayor is also the city representative to the central and state government. The second tier is the head council. It is the counsel of all elected department heads and is headed by the mayor. They advise and guide the mayor and discuss all city issues in a weekly meeting. The elected department heads, also have powers outside of the head council. They are are the most powerful members of their department. They head their department counsel which is a body of all elected members if that department and also comprises of the appointed head of the department. They also head the department board which comprises of the elected and appointed department head and also comprises of the senior appointed members of the department. The department board works on the implementation of the decisions taken by the department council and can also suggest changes and reconsideration of decisions. They get to make posts and decide the further hierarchy of lower levels which they can change whenever necessary.<br> 
The department-wise division has mostly already been explained. The elected members of the government will also be parts of the department(s) they have chosen and will make the department counsel which makes collective decisions( ⅔ votes) in matters not concerning any other department. In matters that affect other departments are raised by the elected department head in the head counsel which will draft a decision that will be deliberated upon and edited by the main council which will have the final say in passing it.<br><br>

Adding departments<br>
We know that change is necessary and at some time or the other, new departments can be added. They may be done one of 2 ways.<br> 
A person willing to contest elections can choose ‘other’ departments while applying. They will be asked to write a detailed vision about the new department, its functions and powers. This will then be deliberate upon in the main counsel and the department may or may not be formed. In an event where the forming of a new department is rejected, the application of the person wanting to contest the elections will also be rejected. One looking forward to standing for the member of a new department must give his/her application at least 3 months prior to the elections and the old main council has 1 month to deliberate upon it. They decide whether or not to add. After that 1 month is given to people who want to apply for that department. For its first term, a new department made this way will be closely monitored by the main counsel.<br>
The second way to add a department is when it is proposed by a member of the main counsel. This can then be deliberated upon and be worked in detail by the main council. It can be closely monitored and helped till they till enough members have been appointed or elected. <br><br> 

Appointing members<br> 
Appointed members will be chosen through a civil service examination. they will happen once a year and only a limited number of people will be selected. The number of people selected will be based on the number of people that are required. Each department sets their respective paper and can make a few necessary changes in their selection process but there is a more or less standard procedure before and after the exam, with a somewhat similar paper pattern across all departments.<br>
To apply for the examination, each candidate has to submit necessary proof of all qualifications and any other documentation that the respective department demands for. After all documents have been verified, each department conducts an exam. This exam is annual. The exam will consist of mainly 3 sections but departments are welcome to add more sections. One will be about the work of the department. The second will be different for different applicants in the same department but different posts as it will cover work related questions of that post. Even though every department is green and the sustainable part of the job is also added in the above sections. A separate section about sustainability will also be added. Apart from this departments are free to add whatever sections or types of questions they deem necessary.<br> 
After this the few selected from the test will be interviewed by a group of 2-3 board members. After this departments may add more steps but they are free to move to the next stage. Many of the applicants  are provisionally employed. This number is greater than the required number but is still somewhat close to it. The length of the provisional period can be anywhere between 1 to 6 months depending on what the department wants it to be. At the end of the provisional period, excess or less productive people will be removed.<br> 
For a new department, the exam is done right after it is made and is again conducted at the yearly time when all exams are conducted. These exams are looked over by the whole local government.<br> 

Choosing new board member<br>
A new board member is needed when a need for a new senior post is felt or when an old board member is no more good enough for their job or when they retire or die. The new board member is usually an experienced member of the appointed staff who works on the same aspects of the department as the new board member needs to work on. A line of succession will already be chosen but instead of choosing them in a way where they get chances one after the other, 5-10 members are chosen all of which can be potential board members but only one will be chosen after a series of interviews and tests. 3 will be chosen to serve a provisional period of 1 month after which 2 will be removed and the new board member will be chosen.<br><br> 

FINANCE<br>
Most of the city's money is generated via non polluting businesses and companies. The economic functioning of the city will be looked over by the main counsel. They will annually meet to devise the city budget. The city budget will comprise of funding allocated to each department and the source they will be obtained from. Like in most countries, a huge part of the income taxes will be given to the central government. The city government can take no more than 5% of the incomes of the people. On the other hand they can reduce it as much as they want. Apart from income tax, they are allowed to impose a second  set of taxes in the form of an indirect tax. This tax set is the tax on polluting. This tax will be imposed in 2 forms. First on the producers for all the pollution that they have caused while production. This would encourage industries to take up practices that would allow a greener environment. For eg., it will be cheaper for the industries to treat their sewage rather than dumping it in water bodies. Similarly, it would be cheaper to have power backup in the forms of solar or wind power rather than diesel-powered engines. We know it’s not possible to have zero pollution industries, but this certainly lowers industry pollution. Not only that. Because we know that it is not possible to have zero pollution industries, this could be a reliable source of income for the city authorities. 
The second form will be on the people. As in when they buy the goods. Buying a good that was responsible for greater pollution will mean more expensive products, diverting people to products that are greener. But as some or the other level of harm will be caused to the environment by the goods that people use, hence this could also function as a source of revenue for city authorities. The carbon taxes will have no maximum unlike the income tax.   
The job of the main counsel here will be to revise taxes and estimate the annual tax collection while allocating money to each department. Apart from the regular budget. A separate HDI fund will be set up which will direct money and attention to improving HDI which is mainly affected by factors like Health and Education.<br><br>
  
DEPARTMENT WISE LIST<br><br> 


Sustainability<br>
This department is one of the most special departments. This department works in collaboration with all departments. Overlapping work from other departments with this need not be taken to the head counsel till a third department is also included in the overlap, unlike any other department. They monitor the functioning of all other departments and ensure that all green regulations that are set and annually revised by them are being properly followed. In case they are not, they have the right to raise this in any counsel they wish to. They may also be approached for help and guidance or can send help if they feel that it is necessary, from there end, to help them function in a more green and clean functioning of their department. They also fund various researches for greener technology like greener transport methods, and mostly obtain their revenue from the central government. They are also responsible for waste management, and management of parks of the city to ensure a sustainable environment.<br><br> 

Election and appointment Department<br>
The election department is also a special department. First of all, it has no elected members. Second it is independent from the main counsel. It means that the main counsel cannot interfere in the functioning of this department. They run the elections and appointment procedures to the local government. Members here are appointed via a complicated and long procedure that consists of various tests, interviews, training sessions and provisional periods. The detailed procedure is revised and reworked each year when the department appoints new members.<br><br> 

Utilities<br>  
This department looks into the water, sewage and electric facilities and transportation. They maintain the water pumping stations and sewage treatment plants along with the network of water tanks and pipes used to facilitate their smooth functioning. In case the city needs to be expanded or newer regions need water supply, they will have to contact this department. Apart from this they also control the biological waste obtained from the sewage. This waste, with the guidance of the department of sustainability, is turned into organic fertiliser which is sold for cheap prices to the agriculture department, and acts as a secondary source of revenue to undertake projects. As for electricity, they manage the solar and wind farms which provide electricity to the whole city.<br><br> 

Food <br> 
This department looks into food production and distribution in the city. They look over farming in the city. Most of the farmland is not private but government and they mostly automate it with a very few humans all of which are appointed. They practice organic farming and obtain a large part of organic fertiliser from the water and sewage department. In the farming region, there are also organic meat farms to obtain non-cattle meat. Cattle meat and milk is obtained from cattle houses in sector parks, whose animals feed on the grass grown in the parks itself. A part of the The food produced is sold at cheap prices to the general public. A part is kept as buffer stock and a third part is sold to various companies which they further process into different food items. They are also responsible to run quality checks on factory made and other non-government made foods. In collaboration with the department of sustainability, the remainder of government funds after farming input, and the money obtained from selling food at cheap prices, is then used for research of various green farming practices like various natural pesticides and other practices along with sunrise farming technologies such as hypotonic farms.<br><br> 

Education<br> 
This department is probably one of the most important ones. This department quite literally is responsible to ensure a good future for the city. That is the next generation. They look over all the schools, set up new schools if they feel it is required. They also revise the curriculum annually. A subject about greener technologies and sustainability is also taught. The curriculum of this subject is designed with the collaboration of the department of sustainability. This will be to increase public awareness, and to teach children about what kind of a green technological utopia can possibly exist in the coming years. They also fund colleges and universities in the city to help them improve education. They also fund schools to provide cheap, quality education. They also are responsible for teacher training and control teacher hiring in schools to ensure that the best teachers teach the children. Apart from the normal funding they get, they also can take parts of the HDI funding to further improve education facilities and quality.<br><br> 

Health<br> 
This department focuses on improving and running health facilities. They directly run the main city hospital, which controls all other hospitals, clinics and dispensaries. It is very crucial as a healthy person can contribute way more to their fields as they will be more productive. To make the medical field more environment friendly, they have a joint project along with the sustainability department, to dispose of medical waste in a green way. They also help expand other facilities that help improve health, such as yoga gardens, public gyms etc.

<hr><h1>HEALTH SYSTEM</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="h">
<hr><h1>

To make an efficient well developed health system in a city we have to agree on a common understanding on what a well developed health system look like. The building blocks allow a definition of various desirable attributes that a health system should have the capacity to do in terms of, for example, health financing.  While the building blocks provide a useful way of clarifying essential functions, the 
challenges facing countries rarely manifest themselves in this way. Rather, they require a more 
integrated response that recognizes the inter-dependence of each part of the health system
According to World Health Organisation "Framework of strengthing health system to improve health outcomes"  there are 6 building blocks of a health system:<br>
•	 Good health services are those which deliver effective, safe, quality
personal and non-personal health interventions to those that need
them, when and where needed, with minimum waste of resources.<br>
•	 A well-performing health workforce is one that works in ways that
are responsive, fair and efficient to achieve the best health outcomes
possible, given available resources and circumstances (i.e. there are
sufficient staff, fairly distributed; they are competent, responsive and
productive).<br> 
•	 A well-functioning health information system is one that ensures
the production, analysis, dissemination and use of reliable and timely
information on health determinants, health system performance and
health status.<br>
•	 A well-functioning health system ensures equitable access to essential
medical products, vaccines and technologies of assured quality,
safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and their scientifically sound and
cost-effective use.<br>
•	 A good health financing system raises adequate funds for health, in
ways that ensure people can use needed services, and are protected
from financial catastrophe or impoverishment associated with having
to pay for them. It provides incentives for providers and users to be
efficient.<br>
• Leadership and governance involves ensuring strategic policy
frameworks exist and are combined with effective oversight, coalition-<br>
building, regulation, attention to system-design and accountability.<br><br>
 Information<br><br>

Development in facilities that provide us  information, intelligence and research very important and vital for a formation of a well developed healthcare system. For this a well developed and efficient  health information system is required. A health information system  refer to a system  designed to manage health care  data. This includes facilities that collect, store, manage and transmit a patient's electronic medical record.
For this purpose skilled management for lab testing, Xray testing, MRI scans etc.would be recruited and latest technology would be used for correct and accurate testing and gaining patients information.<br>
 Inside the house-<br>
a)Daylighting<br>
Is a practice of placing windows,reflective surfaces and other openings to allow the light to enter the homes and illuminate surroundings.  The case studies show that lighting conditions in houses contribute to many factors related to work satisfaction, productivity and well-being and significantly higher visual acceptance scores under daylighting than electrical lighting. In Hillwood houses the following will be installed-<br>
1) Light tubes<br>
2)Smart Glasses<br>
3) Translucent Walls<br>

b)Composting toilet-<br><br>

Composting toilet is a type of toilet which treats human excreta by biological processes. This helps in making manure for the plants and promote sustainability.<br>
c)Sustainable Furniture<br>
Sustainable Furniture is furniture is made from recyclable materials like-<br>
1)Wood<br>
2)Metal<br>
3) Aluminium<br>
4)Plywood<br>
5)Bamboo<br>
6) Rattan<br>
Ditching of chemicals harmful to environment for making furniture is necessary.<br><br>
 Solar Panels<br><br>

WORKING AT HOMES<br>
Solar panels work by absorbing sunlight with photovoltaic cells, generating direct current (DC) energy and then converting it to usable alternating current (AC) energy with the help of inverter technology. AC energy then flows through the home’s electrical panel and is distributed accordingly. Here are the main steps for how solar panels work for your home:<br>
1.	Photovoltaic cells absorb the sun’s energy and convert it to DC electricity<br>
2.	The solar inverter converts DC electricity from your solar modules to AC electricity, which is used by most home appliances<br>
3.	Electricity flows through your home, powering electronic devices<br>
4.	Excess electricity produced by solar panels is fed to the electric grid.<br><br>
 Medical Products and  Vaccines<br><br> 

 1. Medical Products- Medical products is necessary for a well developed system. If medical products are not available in the market people will not be able to get well which can lead to a danger to the future of the city. Access to medical products,medicines and other health products is very important.They form an essential component of health systems in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease and in reduce disability and functional deficiency.<br>
2. Vaccines- Vaccines is a way to increase one's natural immunity by injecting a weakened pathogen into the body. Importance of vaccines can be clearly  seen today where millions and millions of scientists rush to find a cure of Coronavirus commonly known as the covid-19. Many lethal diseases like smallpox has been completely eradicated from the world with the help of .<br>   
To increase the pace of formation of health products and vaccines various  plans in our city will be made. A separate division or wing  will be made in the hospital and the government which will research on formation of new vaccines and new medical products. To ensure that there is a regular supply of medical products and these products are accessible to everyone each sector of the city will have two pharmacy stores.<br><br>
 Service Delivery<br><br>

People Centred Care and integrated health system is very important for formation of a health system. Is the health system accessible to everyone in the city? Do the patients receive the treatment and supplies they are entitled to? Half the world lack access to essential health services. To prevent this, a three tier system of health facilities is made:<br>
1.Primary Health Services- These services will include dispensaries, polyclinics and community health centers which will be located in neighborhood communities.These clinics serve as the first point of contact for the population, offer timely services, and reduce the load of referrals to secondary and tertiary health facilities and in the city.<br>
2. Secondary Healthcare Services- Secondary Healthcare refers to a second tier of health system, in which patients from primary health care are referred to specialists in higher hospitals for treatment. There will be in total 4
secondary health center located in all the four directions of the city<br>
3.Tertiary Health Services- These Health Services will be provided by four specialized consultative hospital which will be located at the heart of the city. These tertiary health services will include   advanced medical services and latest technology and usually treat patients that are referred from the primary and secondary health care services.<br><br>
 Health Workforce<br><br>

For a well developed health system it is very crucial to have  available,competent, responsive and productive health workforce.  Health workforce includes health service providers and health 
management and support workers. By improving feedback mechanisms among health workforce. Improving the health workspace and increasing safety and availability of resources andsupplies to develop effective management. Encouraging and empowering health workers to identify problems and experiment and develop their own solution. Health system budgets need to balance these three vital demands – human resources, physical capital and consumables. Knowledgeable and skilled health workforce is very important. For this advit will tell you about the various policies he has made for improvement in the condition of health workforce.
 Leadership and Governance<br><br>

Being the most complex yet crucial topic it is very important for a well developed health system to have a well developed health ministry as well. Good governance is required for establishment of strategic policies and planning. Accountability and transparency is yet another topic 
that should be of utmost importance for establishment of well developed health system.
 Planning a site<br><br>

 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines sustainable construction as "the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout<br>
 a building's life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. For constructing houses and buildings in hillwood the following things will be kept in mind-
1) Reduction in construction waste.<br>
2) Implementation of surveying drones<br>
3)Usage of innovative methods and technology<br><br>
 Financing<br><br> 

A well developed and designed health system raises adequate funds for health. Financing system in the city can be improved by the following ways-<br>
1. Make people realise that a well developed health system is the need of the hour. Because many people won't spend their money if they do not release  its value.<br>
2.Making frequent Investments in the healthcare system.<br>
3. Full transparency in the health funding system.<br>
4 .Strong budget dedicated by the government to a formation of a well  developed system.</h1><hr>

<hr><h1>SEWAGE DISPOSAL AND TREATMENT</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="j">
<hr><h1>SEWAGE DISPOSAL AND TREATMENT
WHAT IS SEWAGE?<br><br>

Sewage is the mixture of liquid, faeces, toilet paper and food wastes produced by people. The liquid in sewage includes urine (piss) and wastewater which comes from the toilet, the kitchen, bathroom and laundry.<br>

Sewage contains lots of disease-causing germs and parasites. Sewage is treated to get rid of as much of the solid matter as possible. The remaining liquid is called effluent.<br><br>

DISPOSAL<br><br>
Getting rid of sewage and effluent is called sewage disposal. If sewage is not disposed of or contained correctly people may come into contact with it and get very sick. <br><br>

There are different ways to dispose of sewage. Whichever method is used, it is important to make sure that it does not: <br>
•	cause dangerous conditions which allow people to come into contact with disease-causing germs <br>
•	cause pollution of a water supply<br> 
•	allow the breeding of insects such as mosquitoes or cockroaches which can carry disease-causing germs inside or on their bodies as a result of eating or walking in sewage<br> 
•	produce bad smells<br><br>

RESULTS OF IMPROPER SEWAGE DISPOSAL<br><br>
Disease-causing germs can be spread from sewage if it is not disposed of properly or if people do not practise proper toilet hygiene (cleanliness). If a sewage disposal system is not properly maintained it will not be able to get rid of the sewage safely. For a sewage system to be properly maintained, all faulty (blocked, damaged, broken or worn-out) parts must be mended as soon as possible after they stop working correctly. <br><br>









TREATMENT<br><br>
Every community should have a way of disposing of sewage so that people, animals and flies cannot touch it. This is called a sewage system.<br>

There are different types of sewage systems which can be described as on-site systems and sewage or effluent systems.<br>

An on-site system is one which treats the sewage in a septic tank so that most of the sewage becomes effluent and is disposed of in an area close to the house or buildings. An example of an on-site disposal system consists of a septic tank and leach drains. <br><br>

A sewage or wastewater system disposes of the effluent from a community at a central place usually called a sewage lagoon or effluent pond. The sewage can be treated:<br> 
•	in a septic tank at each building <br>
•	just before the lagoon in a large septic tank or macerator system, or<br> 
•	in the lagoon itself<br>
 On-site disposal systems<br>
All the liquid waste from the toilet, bathroom, laundry and sink goes into pipes which carry it to a septic tank. The effluent from the tank is then disposed of through effluent disposal drains often referred to as leach or French drains. Both of these methods of disposing of liquid waste are on-site disposal systems. They must be installed and maintained properly.<br><br>

In these systems, the effluent is soaked into the surrounding soil. Some soils don't allow good soakage such as clay or similar soils; if there are any problems with this disposal system a local government EHO should be consulted to talk about the problem.<br>
 
 Plan view (top) of an on-site sewage disposal system.<br>

On-site disposal systems cannot be installed in all situations. For example, they cannot be installed: 
•	in areas that flood regularly <br>
•	in areas that have a high water table (that is, where the underground water is close to the surface) <br>
•	where the amount of wastewater to be disposed of is large<br> 
•	near to drinking water supplies<br>
 Effluent (wastewater) disposal system<br>
In this method the effluent from the community is carried by large pipes to the lagoon. These pipes serve all the houses and other buildings in the community. The sewage may be either be treated in septic tanks at the houses or buildings or at the lagoon. There are no leach or French drains.<br><br>
 




 Full sewage system<br><br>
All the sewage from the toilet, shower, laundry and other areas enters waste and sewer pipes directly and is pumped to a lagoon. <br>
•	There are three types of full sewage system:<br> 
•	The sewage enters the lagoon without treatment<br> 
•	The sewage goes through a series of cutting blades which help break up the solid matter before it enters the lagoon. These blades are called macerators.<br>
 

•	The sewage may be treated in a large septic tank just before it enters the lagoon.<br>

<hr><h1>POLLUTION FREE ENVIRONMENT</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="l">
<hr><h1>Pollution is a negative externality – a cost to society. To reduce pollution, the government can use four main policies – tax to raise the price, subsidise alternatives, regulations to ban certain pollutants and pollution permits.<br><br>
	0.	 Tax<br>
The idea of a tax is to make consumers and producers pay the full social cost of producing pollution. For example, petrol tax or a carbon tax.
Evaluation<br>
	•	The advantage of this scheme is that the government raises substantial revenue, which could be used to finance other pollution reduction schemes (e.g. subsidising alternatives)<br>
	•	It provides a market incentive for firms to offer more efficient engines, which cause less pollution. Increased petrol tax has created an incentive for firms and consumers to switch to less fuel intensive engines.<br> 
	•	Carbon tax also encourages alternative energy by making it cost-competitive with cheaper fuels. A tax on a plentiful and inexpensive fuel like coal raises its per British Thermal Unit(Btu) price to one comparable with cleaner forms of power. A Btu is a standard measure of heat energy used in industry. One Btu is the energy necessary to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.<br><br>

	0.	Subsidies<br>
A tax may be ineffective if there are no practical alternatives. However, if the government subsidies alternatives, then firms and consumers will be more willing to switch. For example, solar power is an alternative to burning coal. A government subsidy can make solar power competitive and encourage its development. The subsidy is justified because the development of solar power has a significant positive externality. Subsidies have been used for a wide variety of purposes, including: brownfield development after a hazardous substance contamination; agricultural grants for erosion control; low-interest loans for small farmers; grants for land conservation; and loans and grants for recycling industrial, commercial and residential products. While subsidies offer incentives to reduce emissions similar to a tax, they also encourage market entry to qualify for the subsidy.<br><br>

	0.	Regulation<br>
The EU has created many regulations for limiting the amount of pollution in the air. EU pollution regulations. This sets strict limits on the number of pollutants put into the air. The advantage of regulation is that they create clearly defined goals and can make sure that pollution levels are actually reduced rather than relying on market-based incentives, which may or may not work.
In the 1950s, the Clean Air Act (1956) was very effective in reducing the visible smogs from cities, such as London. The act banned the burning of coal in domestic homes in major cities.<br><br>

	0.	 Pollution Permits<br>
Pollution permits are a market-based scheme aimed at reducing pollution and trying to encourage firms to reduce the quantity of pollution they create. Permits create a financial incentive to pollute less because you can then sell your excess permits to other firms. In theory, it can be a good way to reduce pollution, using the incentives of the market.<br> 
Pollution permits involve giving firms a legal right to pollute a certain amount e.g. 100 units of Carbon Dioxide per year. If the firm produces less pollution it can sell its pollution permits to other firms. However, if it produces more pollution it has to buy permits from other firms or the government. This creates a market for pollution permits with the price set by demand and supply. The aim of pollution permits is to provide market incentives for firms to reduce pollution and reduce the external costs associated with it. For example, it is argued carbon dioxide emissions contribute towards global warming. Pollution permits can also be a way for the government to raise revenue, by selling firms these permits to allow pollution.<br><br>

	0.	Afforestation<br>
Over the last decade, the talk on global warming and climate change has dominated major events and conferences. Politicians and global leaders have campaigned under the idea of helping combat the issues of global warming. As such, afforestation has been one of the most talked-about methods of dealing with global warming. It refers to the process of sowing seeds or planting trees in an area that does not have trees to create a forest.<br><br>

<hr><h1>INDUSTRIES</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="n">
<hr><h1>An Industry is a sector that produces goods or related services within an economy. The major source of revenue of a group or company is an indicator of what industry it should be classified in.<br>












 
How Industries Can Advance Sustainable Development Goals     
Develop more resource efficient machinery that generates less effluent, waste and pollutants.<br>
Apply a circular economy mindset when designing products so that there is improved end-of-product lifecycle reuse and recycling.<br>
Incorporate innovative technologies, such as 3D printing, into manufacturing processes to reduce waste from long-run production and prototyping.<br>
Develop and implement improved processes (e.g. closed loop manufacturing) to reduce, reuse and recycle water, raw materials, non-renewable minerals, other inputs, by-products and waste.<br>
Source materials from sustainable sources (e.g. forestry products) and components with lower embedded energy.<br>
Increase energy efficiency in industrial manufacturing plants and across distribution networks.<br>
Increase the proportion of materials and components that are sourced locally in low and middle income countries.<br>
Build the resilience of suppliers in emerging economies to reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.<br><br>
Elementary units of Industries




Workforce<br>
Your workforce should be equipped with the latest technologies that can help them to maximize their productivity. When downtime events occur, plants notify workers through some form of alarm system. In most cases, lights flash and bells ring. Maintenance workers are sometimes paged, or screens may display messages. <br><br>
Processes<br>
The very nature of modern auto manufacturing is driving a tremendous amount of complexity in their processes. Manufacturers have the daunting challenge of trying to unifying several disparate manufacturing processes and data to build a more cohesive and efficient operation.<br><br>
Workers spend excessive amounts of time collecting, analysing and presenting data from their business systems. There are also problems of inconsistent data between teams and an over reliance on a manual handling of the data, which can lead to human errors, such as the wrong parts being ordered.<br><br>
Equipment<br>
Equipment is one of the largest capital investment manufacturers make and look for opportunities for continuous improvements throughout the manufacturing operations life-cycle.<br><br> 
Increased machine data and advance diagnostics empowers your workers with greater visibility into plant-floor equipment, helping to ensure they have accurate and timely data on current machine performance. This allows them to make more informed decisions on asset utilization and can help identify production barriers to improve OEE.<br><br>
Safety<br>
Safety is intrinsic to your workforce, processes and equipment. It shouldn’t be viewed as a single, separate element within each of these different components. Instead, safety should be viewed holistically, across your operations.<br><br>

<hr><h1>GOOD EDUCATION</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="q">
<hr><h1>Good quality education is an essential tool for achieving a more sustainable world.
The concept of Education for sustainable development (ESD) developed largely from environmental education, which has sought to develop the knowledge, skills, values, attitudes and behaviours in people to care for their environment. The aim of ESD is to enable people to make decisions and carry out actions to improve our quality of life without compromising the planet. It also aims to integrate the values inherent in sustainable development into all aspects and levels of learning.

Understanding ESD: ESD is a broad and evolving concept that can be broadly interpreted as holistic and transformational education that addresses learning content and outcomes and the learning environment to achieve societal transformation. Learning content involves integrating critical issues, such as climate change, poverty reduction, gender equality, biodiversity, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable consumption and production into the curriculum. Learning outcomes encompass promoting core competencies such as critical and systemic thinking, collaborative  decision making, and taking responsibility for present and future generations.

Improving quality of education: Quality education is about what and how people learn, its relevance to today’s world and global challenges, and its influence on people’s choices. 
It is necessary for the principals, heads, educators and other members to pay adequate attention towards bringing about improvements in the quality and efficiency of education. With advancements taking place and with the advent of globalization and modernization, it is necessary to improve quality and efficiency of education. Improving quality and efficiency of education would enable the individuals to satisfactorily achieve academic goals and enhance the standing of educational institutions within the community.





Eco schools and green campuses are important and effective in main streaming sustainability in all aspects of the learning environment which included embedding sustainability and its issues into the curriculum.


Eco schools:  The eco-school strategy focuses on environmental action learning and embeds transformative thinking into everyday school life and communities. The Child Friendly Schools initiative addresses  Education for sustainable development through the rights of every child to quality education. Child friendly schools also address the learning needs of every child regardless of their vulnerabilities.

Information and technology: Information and Communication Technologies is being integrated in teaching and learning across all levels of basic education towards quality in education through the digital literacy programme. Information and communication technologies  literacy and other 21st century learning skills such as critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration and innovation skills for core Education system development competencies are being promoted in schools</h1><hr>
