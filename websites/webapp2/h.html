<hr><h1>                                        RESOURCE EFFICIENCY
Resource efficiency means reducing the quantity of inputs needed to produce a unit of output; simply put, doing more with less. Not only does the reduced consumption of inputs (such as raw materials, energy and water) lead to reduced by-products (including waste, wastewater, air pollution and greenhouse gases per unit of output), it also reduces demand on upstream supply of these inputs along with their environmental costs.<br>
Resource efficiency isn’t only valuable because it is essential for sustained economic growth. Reducing environmental impacts also contributes to the quality of life that comes from living in a healthy, attractive environment.<br> 

Resource efficiency and circular economy aims at achieving sustainable development. As you can see in the given venn diagram both resource efficiency and circular economy objects for the efficient management of waste.<br>
MOTIVE<br>
 So OUR motive is to extract more value from resources, while minimising waste and emissions.<br>
There are genuine opportunities for national and city leaders to improve resource efficiency, reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance ecosystems and minimize environmental risks. Resource efficiency is key for cities to move towards a green economy and contribute to global sustainability. They bring efficiency gains and technological innovation through the proximity of economic activities, while reducing resource and energy consumption as well as providing increased opportunities for consumer choices and sustainable lifestyles.<br>
 These include clean technologies, industry, renewable energies, water services, transport, waste management, green buildings, and sustainable agriculture and forests.<br><br>

Conserving energy and water can help to reduce your costs and minimise emissions.<br>
Improved record keeping and reporting can help you keep track of waste, emissions and costs. This can help you assess your performance and make positive changes.<br><br>


RECYCLING<br>
Mainly due to the high labour costs, in many countries automated material separation processes are nowadays commonly adopted for recycling complex products such as e-waste. In consequence, proper understanding on the performance of these automated separation processes and the overall efficiency of multi-stage recycling schemes is required for adequate investment planning.<br>  
To illustrate this, the recycling of LCD TVs is analysed in detail as a case study.<br>
Ok so if we talk of benefits  of recycling there are many,
Benefits of Recycling:<br>
•	Recycling reduces the need for landfill waste.<br>
•	Recycling reduces pollution.<br>
•	Recycling saves energy.<br>
•	Recycling decreases greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
•	Recycling conserves natural resources.<br>
•	Recycling helps sustain the environment.<br>


•	Locate recycling bins near trash containers throughout the property to encourage recycling.<br>
•	Clearly label recycling containers.<br>
•	Keep recycling areas and containers clean and free of odors.<br>
•	Monitor for pests.<br>
•	Create an incentive program to reward tenants who recycle properly and regularly.<br><br>


5RS PRINCIPLE , the basic principle involves
The 5 R's – Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle.
5Rs: the Policy stresses on 5Rs Principle  and claims it as key to drive resource efficiency.  The agenda is to develop a circular economy.<br>
•	The agenda of  Reduce is To limit the amount of materials you use<br>
•	Reuse is To use an item again. This is actually even better than recycling because the process of recycling uses some energy.<br> 
•	
•	Recycle: To collect items such as newspaper, bottles, and cans and bring to a plant where they can be made into something new as already explained.<br> 
•	Refuse: Avoid purchasing or using items that are not recyclable. For example say plastic , replace it with other alternatives.<br>
•	Repurpose: to use it for another purpose than its original.<br><br> 

DAMS<br>
Dams  serve to ensure an adequate supply of water by storing water in times of surplus and releasing it in times of scarcity, thus also preventing or mitigating floods and making a significant contribution to the efficient management of finite water .  If we talk about the best location for dams , then one of the best places for a dam is a narrow part of a deep river valley . the valley slides then can act as natural walls. The primary function of the dams structure is to fill gap in the natural reservoir line left by the stream channel.
•	The basic uses of dams include irrigation in fields, flood control,water storage, debris control and water supply. Apart from this also for  electrical generation.<br><br>


SOLAR PANELS<br>
 SOLAR PANELS ARE AN   ARRANGEMENT OF SOLAR CELLS MOUNTED IN  A FRAME. Solar cells are typically made from silicon, which is a semiconductor and can generate electricity. This process is known as the “photovoltaic effect” 
SO IF WE TALK ABOUT A HOUSE,
16 solar panels are required to run a house.<br><br>

WORKING AT HOMES<br>
Solar panels work by absorbing sunlight with photovoltaic cells, generating direct current (DC) energy and then converting it to usable alternating current (AC) energy with the help of inverter technology. AC energy then flows through the home’s electrical panel and is distributed accordingly. Here are the main steps for how solar panels work for your home:<br>
1.	Photovoltaic cells absorb the sun’s energy and convert it to DC electricity<br>
2.	The solar inverter converts DC electricity from your solar modules to AC electricity, which is used by most home appliances<br>
3.	Electricity flows through your home, powering electronic devices<br>
4.	Excess electricity produced by solar panels is fed to the electric grid<br><br>

Solar farms<br>
Solar farms are large scale solar installations where photovoltaic (PV) panels, referred to as solar panels, or other means of collecting solar energy, like concentrating solar systems are used to harvest the suns power.<br><br> 


Working of solar farms
– They generate electricity locally and feed into the local electricity grid using a free source of energy (the sun) to generate electricity  on bright cloudy days as well as in direct sunlight.<br>
– For every  5MW installed, a solar farm will power over 1,500 homes annually (based on an average annual consumption of 3,300 kWh of electricity for a house) and save 2,150 tonnes of CO2. Approximately 25 acres of land is required for every 5 megawatts (MW) of installation.<br><br>

HOW IS IT USEFUL<br>
Sun is a renewable source of efficiency and is expected to last for 5 billion years. Hence solar panels are one of the best method for resource efficiency.
Solar panels can be used to generate a portion of your home's power in order to reduce your dependency on traditional power sources.
 For instance, you can install panels to provide electricity just for appliances or lighting, to reduce your dependency on the utility company, as well as lower your bill.
  If you live in an area with high energy rates and a suitable solar rating and can afford the initial investment, it's worth installing solar panels in your home  — for the good of the environment and your wallet.  
solar could contribute 20% of total electricity consumption by 2030.<br><br> 

What if there is no sunlight , there are two solutions net metering and solar storage technology
Net metering - Net metering (also known as net energy metering or NEM) is a solar incentive that allows you to store energy in the electric grid. When your solar panels produce more electricity than you need, that energy is sent to the grid in exchange for credits. Then, at night or other times when your solar panels are underproducing, you pull energy from the grid and use these credits to offset the costs of that energy.
Solar storage technology.<br>
Energy storage systems provide a wide array of technological approaches to managing our power supply in order to create a more resilient energy infrastructure and bring cost savings to utilities and consumers. These include<br><br>
•	Batteries – a range of electrochemical storage solutions, including advanced chemistry batteries, flow batteries, and capacitors<br><br>
•	Thermal – capturing heat and cold to create energy on demand or offset energy needs<br><br>
•	 Mechanical Storage – other innovative technologies to harness kinetic or gravitational energy to store electricity<br><br>
•	Hydrogen – excess electricity generation can be converted into hydrogen via electrolysis and stored<br><br>


 
 WINDMILLS<br>
A windmill is a structure that converts wind power into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades, specifically to mill grain, but the term is also extended to windpumps, wind turbines and other applications.
<br><br>
Wind farms<br>
A wind farm or wind park, also called a wind power station or wind power plant, is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity. Most onshore wind turbines have a capacity of 2-3 megawatts (MW), which can produce over 6 million kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity every year. That’s enough to meet the electricity demand of around 1,500 average households.
<br><br>

 
.

Wind energy is a source of renewable energy. It does not contaminate, it is inexhaustible and reduces the use of fossil fuels, which are the origin of greenhouse gasses that cause global warming. In addition, wind energy is a “native” energy, because it is available practically everywhere on the plant, which contributes to reducing energy imports and to creating wealth and local employment.
