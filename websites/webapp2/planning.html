<h1><hr>The tremendous effort of the group in using their brains to formulate a plan on which our group's functioning and survival in this competition would depend.When i said the word 'planning' u might have referred it to the meaning that the leader would 
divide the work, declare the deadline of submission, or even decide what all stuff should be there in the presentation.But honestly speaking but we functiioned here as a democracy where in which we respected each other's ideas.selecting topics had always been 
in respect to everyone's idealogies. Once the topics were alloted to us, we started working on it.We were given a  deadline of 10th may to complete our research work and possibly merge them into a source(like ppt), for us that source was our trump card(which might give us shot to win).
This website might be the key to us winning the competetion. The deadline was fixed keeping the following things in mind:<br>
<br>
.the preperation for the presentation<br>
<br>
.checking everybody's work<br>
<br>
.creating a speech for the final speech<br>
<br>
.rehearsing<br>
<br>Finally the day came, when we had to face our nervousness,the truth and about a 40 teams who could be better than us.<hr></h1>
