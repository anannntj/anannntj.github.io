<h1><hr>Upto the 1980s Gurgaon was just a small collection of villages. That is when the Maruti Suzuki plant was set up in Gurgaon. Also a lot of trade rules were changed in 1991. Both these things lead to huge development. With the Suzuki plant, many companies that made parts(outsourced by Suzuki) started setting up plants. Employees started comming in residential space was set up and stuff was made. When after 1991 MNCs started comming into India outsourcing work, then they looked for options other than Delhi as  it was too expensive. Gurgaon being 15 miles from Delhi was the perfect option. As Gurgaon was under state control as it did not have a local government, therefore almost all private projects were approved in a matter of days without any centralised planning. This lead to mindless urbanisation covering almost the whole city in roads and buildings with huge populations. Seriously idr where but I read that the pop grew 17 times in 25 years. The main reason for this mess of a city is unplanned urbanisation.Health Facilities
There are very less public services available in Gurgaon. This would include public transport(that forces everyone to drive cars or uber, which rarely are electric in India), public healthcare facilities(that forces the people to go to expensive private hospitals that are good but sometimes even tough for the rich to afford).<br><br>

 Pollution-free environment
Gurgaon is polluted as hell with it WINNING the title of THE  most polluted city in the world according to data released by IQ Air Visual and Greenpeace.  I myself have seen AQIs over 800 where the air is just smoke. The level of other types of pollution are high too check the link given.(https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/in/Gurgaon).<br><br>

Renewable sources of energy
Gurgaon is a part of Haryana. Haryana has mainly 6(now 5 cause after the Panipat thermal powerplant was closed) sources of electricity. 5(4) of these are thermal powerplants and only one hydroelectricity power station with low(many folds than the other 4 sources of electricity)  power generation. Though they are now adopting solar power as an alternative, commercially it is still mostly powered on conventional sources of energy.<br><br>

Resource efficiency
In a survey conducted last year, the richest city in Haryana(which without a doubt is Gurgaon) had a very poor performance with almost all of its 600-tonne waste produced daily almost all of which goes untreated and the sewage system has already been talked of above. Talking of circular economy and resource efficiency in Gurgaon is something for which I couldn’t even find an analogy for.<br><br> 

Public awareness
Public of this city know about pollution and how harmful it is but remains blissfully unaware of the environmental state of their very own city. Before I started researching for this, I was unaware of the fact that I was producing sewage that ends up in rivers and use electricity that nither comes from the central power line nor is renewable. The city is too beautifully covered up by luxuries that come on the cost of the environment that people are unaware of. I spent hours on official sites trying to find out where our waste goes, where our electricity comes from etc.. but the information is either not public or too deeply hidden to be easily found.<br><br>

Land use management and Biodiversity protection
The land of Gurgaon is impossibly chaotic. The city was built without any planning with roads coming out of nowhere and huge farm estates being covered with skyscrapers cause private builders could afford to buy it in millions… I have myself seen the place I live in as a farmland with my very eyes as a 3-year-old yet it stands now with skyscrapers. The only places which are not covered in this absolute monstrosity is the botanical garden of Gurgaon or its DLF golf club, parts of the Aravali and some outer areas of the city(seriously look at the map of the city). SHockingly Gurgaon is the state’s district that has the highest percentage(17%) of the total forest cover in the entire state(unsurprisingly, only a number just over 3% of the total land of the state accounts as forest cover). This forest region mainly the Aravali region which has seen a huge loss in biodiversity in recent years. Thankfully the authorities now are in the right state of mind and have started town planning(https://www.gmda.gov.in/works/urban-planning.html?language=en) but the protected biodiversity region is apparently still quite low (in the plan) which is a problem.<br><br> 

Clean food and water
Most of the water supplied in Gurgaon is not very clean(well u can call it kinda clean cause at least it is still transparent, but its hard water). Though it is affordable and most accessible to the public, it’s not something that the city has a local source due to the lack of water bodies in the city meaning that almost all the cities water has been obtained from sources outside the city. Unlike in many places, Gurgaon is a place where drinking water from the tap is unheard from( I was shocked when I heard that people do it). As for food, the farmlands of the city have shrunk to sizes incapable of serving the increasing the population which too is supplied neighbouring regions but is somewhat of good quality and affordable.There was no proper sewage treatment in Gurgaon as recent as 2012(though now a huge part of the sewage is treated) and 2-thirds of the city’s sewage was dumped untreated into rivers (https://ideas.ted.com/skyscrapers-but-no-sewage-system-meet-a-city-run-by-private-industry/).The drainage system absolutely sucks with little rains turning roads to rivers where boat wold work better than cars!<br><br> 

 

Policies
Though the environmental policy of the state(https://tcpharyana.gov.in/ncrpb/FINAL%20SRP%20FOR%20WEB-HOSTING/14_Environment.pdf) which Gurgaon falls in, aims at the protection of forests and rivers along with clean water and air. The proper implementation of these is yet to bee seen. The environmental policy aims towards improvement in areas that the city majorly lacks in and is possibly the only hope to clear this absolute mess that has been seen.<br><br>

<hr><h1>The sustainable development proposal contained 17 goals with 169 targets covering a broad range of sustainable development issues. These included ending poverty and hunger, improving health and education, making cities more sustainable, combating climate change, and protecting oceans and forests. According to these 169 targets I would like to talk about the policies/schemes/initiatives Chandigarh has taken up  to achieve the following:<br><br>

1. No poverty: implementation of the food security act has been successful  in Chandigarh by having an effect on over about 64623 people. The old age pensions,widow pensions and disabled pensions have helped a total of 20148 people in total. More than 12,000 families living in slum areas have already been shifted in flats built under JNNURN. Moreover, 4,960 flats have been constructed and families living in slum colonies will be shifted.<br><br>

2. Zero hunger: AAY is an imitative of Red Cross Society (with initial financial support from HPCL under CSR initiative) to provide affordable food at Rs. 10. everyday around 3,500 to 4,000 packets are prepared under this initiative. Chandigarh Administration implemented the public distribution system by replacing Fair Price Shops with food subsidy.<br><br>

3. Good health and well being: Chandigarh awarded with Certificate of Merit by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare for Maximum improvement in Infant Mortality Rate during the period 2015 -2016. • New hospitals are being constructed with infrastructure being upgraded in existing hospitals to improve medical facilities and Chandigarh Administration is planning a new sports injury centre having provisions like MRI, CT scan, X-ray, Ultrasound etc.<br><br>

4. Quality Education: In Education Sector, Chandigarh Administration is planning to set up two more colleges along with increasing the number of seats in several existing colleges and  have built 200 Smart Classrooms in 9 Government Schools while another 200 Smart Classrooms are due for completion to impart education to students through multimedia projectors. Chandigarh Administration launched a mobile educational/rehabilitation unit for children with special needs.<br><br>

5. Reduced inequalities: To ensure safety and security of Women, Chandigarh has started a facility to make available police car to pick and drop women from any location in Chandigarh after 10:00 PM.<br><br>

6. Sustainable cities and communities: Chandigarh is declared ODF city with 894 public toilets.100% habitation covered with drinking water supply.Chandigarh has been also  declared as a Kerosene Free City and 2,48,049 bbeneficiaries are receiving LPG subsidy under PAHAL.<br><br>

7. Solar Installed Capacity - Chandigarh has an installed capacity of grid connected rooftop and decentralized solar plants of 24.9 MW. It is planned to increase this installed capacity to 37MW and 69MW by 2010 and 2022 respectively.•<br><br>

8. Green Cover - Green cover in Chandigarh is 41.1%. Efforts are being undertaken to increase this area further. Cycle Tracks - Under the Smart City Project, Chandigarh Administration has built 96 Kms of Cycle Track and another 70 Kms is to be completed in the next phase.<br><br>
EDUCATION<br>

Education for sustainable development (ESD) promotes the development of the knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions required to create a sustainable world, which ensures environmental protection and conservation, promotes social equity and encourages economic sustainability. The education provided in Chandigarh is of international standards. The institutes here never compromise on the quality of education. Day by day more schools are coming up as an initiative of the Chandigarh government to supplement further growth in the education sector. They aim to educate every child living in the city and specially reach to the students staying in remote areas.With state of the art facilities, the schools, colleges and universities in Chandigarh provide quality education, which is talked about in the country. Schools educate kids from nursery till higher secondary. Colleges on the other hand, provide conventional or professional courses. There are institutes in Chandigarh that specialize in distance program. The city also has institutes offering vocational courses such as those in animation, computer programming, and graphic designing. To make my material more interesting and informative I will incorporate case study of my own school (Vivek High School, Chandigarh) and a case study of Panjab University Chandigarh to provide you an insight to Chandigarh's curriculum and it's vision.<br><br>
