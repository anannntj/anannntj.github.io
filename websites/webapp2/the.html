<hr><h1>WHY WE OPTED IT</h1><hr>
<h2>While imagining the future, it's almost impossible to imagine a future in which humanity has not ceased to exist or has not reduced to preindustrial primitive beings till you think of Green Cities. Cities that are modern and yet respect the constraints of the biosphere. Cities that make peace with nature, not try to take over it. Group 20 imagines a future of green cities. It is our belief that the  balance between modern and sustainable which is considered to be impossible by man, is in fact possible. We found GRUEN to be the perfect place to spread the word, learn more about,  and to actually get involved in the creation of the cities of the future. Group 20 presents to you ( name of the city: which we want to keep DHOKA)<br>
The whole team had the desire to make the world a better to live for all the life present on the surface of our precious planet,starting with cities.Each of us is very different from each other,different in how we conduct presentations,different on how we we view spicific problems,but the one thing that isn't different is our objective.<br>
In the midst of a very distressful pandemic,we as a team, realised the importance of availability of medical attentions, proper resources and man power,which inturn are the major indicators of a green and sustainable.<br>
We were more motivated in these tough times to take up something that would atleast give us a chance to help make world a better place.It would be a small step towards the development of earth,but atleast it would be step,a step which would bring us closer to finishing our objective.</h2>
