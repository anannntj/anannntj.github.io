<h2>GROUP VISION BY GROUP 20
1.Discussion of EAP objectives
While designing our Gruen city the first thing we discussed was the EAP objectives.EAP objectives were necessary to discuss because it helped us to establish a discussion and gave us a rough idea of how a green city would look like. As mentioned on the forum too EAP objectives gave us a coherent vision to lead sustainable planning and urban development.  It gave us an example of how to establish a framework GRUEN design framework.<br><br>
2. Proposing Criteria for a GRUEN city
This was one of the most crucial and important topics. It helped us to give our presentation a footing. This was the first time group members were able to interact with each other via Zoom and social media platforms like WhatsApp. It enriched us with analysing skills, decision-making skills and helped us to increase our ability to solve problems. It gave us a basic idea on how to really make a green city.  With the team's collaborating skills we were able to summarize the information into a framework.  We gained a lot of knowledge and gave our criteria modifications when we responded to other participants' burning questions.<br><br>
3.Reviewing Our Cities
This helped us to implement the criteria on our city and assess it. This provided us with information and case studies and a basic understanding of how the city will look like. It helped us to trace our city's history and geography. It was such a fun learning experience to get to know about each others cities via Adobe connect meeting hosted by Brant Knutzen Sir. The biggest learning by studying Gurgaon and Chandigarh was the importance of planning.<br><br> 
Conclusion: 
We have made this project keeping in our mind our past experiences and discussions on Moodle platform. We are thankful to sir for guiding us throughout this process and helping us in each and every step. All of these discussions on EAP objectives, case studies of various cities helped us to reach our grp vision.
Now we will give you an explanation on our grp statement.<br><br> 
Group 20 envisions a green future. A future where humans and technology donâ€™t try to rule over nature but instead make peace with it. A future where cities are not forests if cement but a bond between environment and tech. A future Where the constraints of the biosphere are respected. This future is the future of green cities. 
We envision Hillwood as an image of this future, which we imagine to follow this balance between taking to little and taking too much which for very long has been believed to be impossible by a huge position of society. We see this city as a sustainable, low carbon, circular economy which is resource-efficient and safeguards its citizens from all environment-related pressures and risks to health and wellbeing and has a very well developed healthcare system.
 We see it as an economy that is not traditional but is no less than well-developed economies around the world and is big enough to allocate reliable funding to the research of sustainability and green technology to enhance knowledge and technology in this field and spreads the message around to world to keep the whole world on the same page      
We see it as a city which would be a model for the whole world to follow with a local legislative body that is very efficient and is incentivised to protect the environment in every way they can and are highly knowledgeable and efficient.   We see this city as utopic to the world around us but not something that cant be built if the right people wanted to. We see it as something that is needed in the green future of humanity before it is too late and we cross the point of no return. 
We believe that green cities are not cities where one hs to cut down on desires and needs but are cities where every desire and need is fulfilled in a green and clean manner. Therefore we aim at sustainable manufacturing, 100% recycling, 100% sewage treatment and look forward to a city whose electricity is obtained form completely clean sources so that every need and desire is fulfilled in a green manner.
We also believe that the inhabitants of this future play the most key role to turn this utopian idea into a practical reality and therefore envision Hillwood to have a very high level of public awareness which is spread via education of all. 
It is of key importance that in such a city, the biodiversity of the large green areas does not reduce and is preserved in a form that is tried not to be disturbed while urbanising the city</h2>
