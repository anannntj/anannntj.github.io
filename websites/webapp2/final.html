<hr><h1>CRITERIAS FOR JUDGING A GREEN CITY</h1><hr>

<div class="a">
<hr><h1>HEALTH</h1><hr>

<div class="b">
<h1>Health plays an important role in sustainability. A healthy population can work towards a good future. A green city should have  a well developed healthcare system which will help in improving the health of millions of people, increasing life expectancy, reducing maternal and child mortality and fighting against leading communicable diseases and help us fight pandemics like the recent Coronavirus. This healthcare system should also focus on mental health as health systems across the world have not yet responded adequately to the current burden of mental disorders, and the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is wide. Many technologically advanced places, for example Japan, face huge mental  health issues. On the face of it, it seems to have no connection with a green city but in fact  a person who is mentally well would help in execution of governmental policies and help in preserving ecological balance. This is something that we definitely need in a city of the FUTUREâ€¦</h1>

<hr><h1>POLICIES</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="d">
<h1>The policies of a green city should be ones that promote improvement of the environment. Things like carbon taxes,expansion of green sources of income , and increasing public awareness, funding of research of upcoming green technologies are a few examples of pro-environment policies. But we need to stay cautious as many things that look environmentally beneficial; do have harmful effects that we don't see at first, for example Dams. They provide renewable energy but it is very difficult to make a dam as it can lead to deforestation and loss of biodiversity, deposition of river carried silt and many other problems. While talking of policies, it is also important that we keep in mind that  forming legislations are useless if they are not executed.

<hr><h1>POLLUTION FREE ENVIRONMENT</h1><hr>
</div>
<div class="f">
<h1>The environment of a green city should be pollution free. The air people breathe should be clean, Rivers should not look like drains, and stars should be visible in the sky. Technology plays a major role here. electric cars, photovoltaic converters, environmental monitoring which is done through satellites etc. Biodiversity needs to be protected too(refer Biodiversity protection). A green city should be one that does not lead to a net gain of environmental pollutants like  Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide,methane,ozone etc. Meaning that their unavoidable( but reducible ) release has to be balanced out by their removal via trees, grass etc. Reduce reuse and recycle are an essential part of a green and sustainable city which also helps in reducing pollution and saving resources.
